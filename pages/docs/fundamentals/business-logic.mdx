# Business logic layer
The business logic layer in OAS Tools is implemented through controllers that are loaded by the router middleware upon initialization. The [routing section](../features/routing) describes how controllers are loaded and how it can be altered to redirect to other controllers. By default, each path declared in the OpenAPI document will have a controller to handle its requests.

## Controllers
The controllers are functions that receive the request and response objects from express in order to perform an operation and return a result through `res.send()` or `res.status().send()`.

When writing a controller you should take into account the name of the exported function (more details in the routing section) and the operation that will be performed.

* GET operations typically receive some parameters. Since controllers receive `req` and `res` objects from express, you can access parsed parameters from `res.locals.oas.params` or in case you want to work with the raw types received by express you can use `req.params` instead.

* POST and PUT operations receive a request body. Just like with paramaters, the body is accesible from `res.locals.oas.body` or `req.body`. 

* Some request may include multipart content. This content will be available at `res.locals.oas.files` or as long as a multipart bodyparser is included in the middleware chain.

> OAS Tools is content agnostic, meaning it could receive JSON or XML in request body as long as a body parser middleware is included in the first position of the middleware chain. Check out the [advanced project setup](../customization/project-setup) for more information about possible integrations with other technologies.

```js
// UserController.js

module.exports.postUser = function post(req, res) {
  const params = res.locals.oas?.params;
  const body = res.locals.oas?.body;
  const files = res.locals.oas?.files;

  /* Perform some operation, like saving to a database */

  res.status(201).send();
};
```
